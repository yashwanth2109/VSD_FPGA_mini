PURPOSE OF THE MODULE:

The purpose of the module named “top” is used to implement a FPGA RGB LED controller which uses an internal oscillator(clock) and a counter(to create a slower clock signal for testing) 
to set the LED to emit blue light while keeping the red and green off.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERNAL LOGIC AND THE OSCILLATOR:
Internal Logic:
led_red, blue, green - controls the LED’s RED, BLUE, GREEN respectively
testwire - acts as a test signal which is set to the 6th bit of frequency_counter_i to create a slower signal for testing
int_osc  - internal oscillator signal
frequency_counter_i[27:0] - 28 bit register which acts as a counter
LOGIC: During the rising edge of int_osc the register bit is incremented
Oscillator:
SB_HFOSC - hardware primitive for high frequency Oscillators
SB_RGBA_DRV - hardware primitive for driving RGB LEDs

CLKHF_DIV(“0b10”) - sets the oscillator frequency to 12MHz
CLKHFPU(1’b1) - Powers up the oscillator 
CLKHFEN(1’b1) - Enables the oscillator
CLKHF(int_osc) - Clock output

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE RGB LED DRIVERS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE OUTPUTS:
RGBLEDEN(1’b1) - Enables the RGB LED Driven
CURREN(1’b1) - Enables the current.
RGB0PWM(1’b0) - Red LED off  (RGB0 - Red)
RGB1PWM(1’b0) - GreenLED off  (RGB1 - Green)
RGB2PWM(1’b1) - Blue LED on  (RGB0 - Blue)
1’b1 = LED On
1’b0 = LED Off
defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB0_CURRENT = “0b000001”;
defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB1_CURRENT = “0b000001”;
defparam RGB_DRIVER.RGB2_CURRENT = “0b000001”;
Defparam sets the current level of each LED.  “0b000001” sets low current to reduce the power consumption
PCF FILE AND PIN ASSIGNMENTS:
set_io  led_red 39            => RED LED  pin 39 in pin assignments = (RGB0)
set_io  led_blue 40          => BLUE LED  pin 40 in pin assignments = (RGB1)
set_io  led_green 41       => GREEN LED pin 41 in pin assignments  = (RGB2)
set_io  hw_clk 20          => HARDWARE CLOCK  pin 20 in pin assignments = (IOB_25b_G3)
set_io  testwire 17         => TESTWIRE pin 17 in pin assignments = (IOB_33b_SPI_SI)
